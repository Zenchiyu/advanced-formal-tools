# Advanced Formal Tools: Project 7. Probabilistic Model Checking with PRISM

Members:

The goal of this project is to explore the domain of probabilistic model checking, which consists of leveraging probabilistic models to analyse programs.
Equipped with the PRISM probabilistic model checker, you will define and verify properties of models of small distributed applications (e.g., cyber physical systems) and/or concurrent programs.
